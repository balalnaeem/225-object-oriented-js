# Assumptions

1. The `isWithinMonthYear` method on `todo` can take numbers or strings for `month` and `year` values as an argument.

2. The `delete` method on `todoList` takes a todo `id` as an argument. `id` can be either number or a string.

3. The `update` method on `todoList` receives properties and values to be updated in an object, and an `id` as an argument. `id` can be either a number or a string

4. The `init` method on `todoList` returns the length of `todos` after initializing the collection with n number of `todo` objects

5. The `getTodo` method on `todoList` returns a copy of the `todo` with the specified `id`. Not the reference to it.

6. The `getAll` method on `todoList` returns copies of all the `todo` objects. Not the references to them.

7. The `withinMonthYear` method on `todoManager` can take strings or numbers for the `month` and `year` values.

8. `todoManager` only has access to copies of the `todo` objects. And that is what it manipulates
